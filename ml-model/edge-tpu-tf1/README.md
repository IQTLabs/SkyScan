# Transfer-learn an object detection model and compile for Edge TPU (TF1)

The scripts in this directory provide everything you need to perform
transfer learning on a quantization-aware object detection model, using
TensorFlow 1.x.

To run the scripts on your local hardware, clone this repository and
then follow the walkthrough at
[coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/retrain-detection/](https://coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/retrain-detection/).
